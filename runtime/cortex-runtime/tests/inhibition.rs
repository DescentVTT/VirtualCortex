//! Brief 039 (ADR-0087) runs H-16 as ADR-0085 wrote it: H-14's configuration — ADR-0077's
//! settled image, the gain 1.75, the controller off, ADR-0076's stimulus, the task as built
//! under `Delivery::Addressed`, the modulation baseline at zero, 1 536 trials — with the one
//! constant moved: the inhibitory baseline of ADR-0086 set at 0.5, so that every synapse of
//! an inhibitory block consolidates half of what it pairs at each presynaptic spike, the
//! dopamine term never reaching it, while every excitatory synapse stays under the reward's
//! gate. The settled engine is built as ADR-0077, ADR-0079, ADR-0081 and ADR-0083 build it
//! and held to ADR-0077's tables; its frozen image — the baseline zero, the inhibitory
//! baseline unset — is the calibration's, a frozen block from it held to ADR-0077's frozen
//! run before any rewarded run; the same image with the inhibitory baseline's flag and value
//! written into the modulator section is the arms'. Three arms of 1 536 trials from that
//! image under the task as built: the assignment and the mirrored assignment
//! (`Feedback::Answer`), and the reward withheld (`Feedback::Withheld`), a reading bounded by
//! no clause. ADR-0079's oracle consolidates every stimulus–readout synapse — all excitatory
//! — under the signal where the synapse is addressed and under zero elsewhere, H-14's rule,
//! held to the record at every trial. The criterion — the correct selections over the last
//! 128 trials at least 80 in both rewarded arms — the assertion (every excitatory synapse
//! outside the two answer pairs ends a rewarded arm as the image holds it, bit for bit, and
//! every excitatory synapse ends the withheld arm so) and ADR-0085's two predicted readings
//! (the inhibitory sum falling in every block; the withheld arm's selection where the frozen
//! network's is) are integer rules written before the run. The three arms are one weekly
//! `exhaustive` test; the gate runs the rules at their edges and eight trials with the
//! inhibitory baseline set.
//!
//! The harness is `tests/instrument.rs`'s, shared as one module and not copied (ADR-0083);
//! since ADR-0084 the weekly shards take tests, not binaries, so this binary's name steers
//! nothing.
