//! Brief 029's instrument, its calibration (ADR-0065) and the measurement through it
//! (ADR-0066): the same rule (ADR-0032), the same selection (`cortex-basal-ganglia` through
//! ADR-0059's task), the same four controls and the same seeds as brief 027's measurement
//! (ADR-0060), with the four changes ADR-0060 named and did not build: a stimulus whose
//! units are spaced beyond the prior's local window so that each fires once, a readout that
//! counts the ticks in which the stimulus's local synapses land, a trial of one time constant
//! of the dopamine signal so that one outcome gates one trial's traces, and a gain the
//! calibration picks from two candidates. Before any reward is given, the calibration shows
//! the readout sees the stimulus at all: the weights frozen (the modulation baseline at zero,
//! no reward), the two readouts' spikes in the window after the volley against the window of
//! the same length before the injection, over sixty-four trials, a pass at fifty-six of them.
//! Every constant is written here before the first rewarded run, derived by a rule from the
//! prior's parameters or picked by the calibration from the candidates listed here; nothing
//! is chosen after a rewarded run.
//!
//! Every number is the engine's own, pinned from one run and held on every worker count and
//! every architecture. Every full run and every calibration is the weekly job's `exhaustive`
//! test; the pull request's gate runs the geometry against the census, the rewarded run's
//! first block at 256 units and the criterion over the pinned tables (ADR-0061). What the
//! numbers decide, and at what scale, is stated in ADR-0066 and in whitepaper §11.1.
